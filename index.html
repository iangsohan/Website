            I am a Computer Science major at the University of Virginia.
            My goal in life is to travel the world and have a family.
            I plan to accomplish my goals by having an enjoyable career that makes a positive impact.

            I am currently a rising third-year student at the University of Virginia.
            I plan to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Sciene along with a minor in Engineering Business.
            My current career and education goals include remaining a member of the Dean's List for the engineering school,
            continue to improve my programming skills and discover what fields I find interesting,
            and be accepted to an internship position as a software engineer.

            I went to the Woodstock Academy in my hometown of Woodstock, CT.
            While attending, I played on the school's soccer team and found a love in wood-working.
            My most notable accomplishments include being president of the Math Honor Society, a member in the National Honor Society,
            and a captain for the school's Relay for Life team.
            Leaving high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I thought I would enjoy economics because that's what my dad studied
            and I enjoyed talking to him about it, but by chance, my first college course was intro to programming and I never looked back.

        <h1 class="subtitle">Hobbies</h1>
        <h2 class="subtext">
            I love to travel, which stems from my early interest in U.S. National Parks.
            Now that I'm older, I'm doing whatever I can to see the beauty in the country.
            I've seen some amazing places, but hopefully soon I'll be able to explore more of the world.

            I have always loved working on projects. In high school, I took two years of wood-working classes, 
            and I absolutley fell in love with it. Although not a very prestigious award, one of the highlights 
            in my life was winning my high school's Golden Hammer Award. Since going to college, the wood shop
            is very limited to the students in the architecture school. Thankfully, I discovered I really enjoy
            programming tasks. I started out with the homework assignments being enough to satisfy my desire
            for creativity, but I began moving to personal projects and hope to never look back.
